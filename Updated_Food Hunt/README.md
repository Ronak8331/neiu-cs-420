# FoodHunt

## **Objective**

The objective of this application is to locate the restaurants around specific location. Online food ordering is beneficial when you do not have a time to go to the restaurant. This application provides the customer with exact customized results on what they need. 

Some of the questions that will be answered with this application are 
- Which restaurants have lower cost per two persons? 
- Which restaurants provide online food delivery? 


## **Motivation**

Motivation to do so comes from personal interest, as my father is in restaurant business. For the restaurant business you need to find the perfect location to get more benefits. To find that location you need to have the information of customer reviews and the restaurants around that location. Having the information about the restaurants around the specific location can help establish the business.
